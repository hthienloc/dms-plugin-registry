## Generative AI

Using an LLM to help write code, issues, or comments is fine. Submitting its output unread is not.

- You are responsible for every line you submit. You have read it, tested it, and can explain it in review.
- Say in the PR when a meaningful part of it was AI generated.
- Do not file issues or leave comments you have not verified yourself. Reports that do not reproduce get closed.
- PRs that read like unreviewed output, with narrating comments, invented APIs, or style that ignores the file they are in, get closed without review.

# Contributing a Plugin

Thank you for contributing to the Dank Material Shell Plugins registry!

## How to Add Your Plugin

1. **Fork this repository**

2. **Create a new JSON file** in the `plugins/` directory following this naming convention:
   ```
   plugins/{github-username}-{plugin-name}.json
   ```
   - Use lowercase letters
   - Separate words with hyphens
   - Examples: `daniel-42-z-powerusage.json`, `rochacbruno-worldclock.json`

3. **Fill in your plugin information** using the schema below:

```json
{
    "id": "pluginId",
    "name": "PluginName",
    "capabilities": ["dankbar-widget"],
    "category": "monitoring",
    "repo": "https://github.com/yourusername/your-plugin-repo",
    "path": "optional/path/in/monorepo",
    "author": "Your Name",
    "description": "Brief description of what your plugin does",
    "dependencies": ["dependency1", "dependency2"],
    "compositors": ["niri", "hyprland"],
    "distro": ["any"],
    "screenshot": "https://url/to/screenshot.png"
}
```

### Field Descriptions

- **id** (required): Unique identifier in camelCase format (e.g., `worldClock`, `powerUsageMonitor`)
  - **Must start with a lowercase letter**
  - **Can only contain letters and digits** (no underscores, hyphens, or spaces)
  - **Must exactly match the `id` field in your repository's `plugin.json` file**
- **name** (required): Display name of your plugin (e.g., `World Clock`, `Power Usage Monitor`)
  - **Must exactly match the `name` field in your repository's `plugin.json` file**
- **capabilities** (required): Array of capabilities, e.g., `["dankbar-widget"]`
- **category** (required): One of: `monitoring`, `utilities`, `appearance`, `system`, etc.
- **repo** (required): Full GitHub URL to your plugin repository
- **path** (optional): If your plugin is in a monorepo, specify the subdirectory path
- **author** (required): Your name or GitHub username
- **description** (required): Clear, concise description of the plugin's purpose
- **dependencies** (required): Array of dependencies, use `[]` if none
- **compositors** (required): Supported Wayland compositors: `["niri", "hyprland"]`, etc.
- **distro** (required): Supported distributions: `["any"]`, `["fedora"]`, `["arch"]`, etc.
- **screenshot** (required): Direct URL to a screenshot image showing your plugin — see [Previews](#previews) for easy ways to produce a good one
- **i18n** (optional): `true` once your plugin has been approved for central translation via the DMS POEditor project — see [Plugin Translations](#plugin-translations). Do not set it in your initial submission.

### Previews

Every plugin gets a standardized 960×540 preview card served at `https://api.danklinux.com/previews/{id}`. The card wraps your `screenshot` in a dank-themed frame with the plugin's name, category, and description; if the screenshot URL ever becomes unreachable, a metadata-only card is served instead.

Screenshots of any aspect ratio work well — the card letterboxes them over a blurred backdrop rather than cropping. Capture your plugin in a representative state (popout open, real data visible) on the default dank purple theme where possible.

If you prefer to hand-craft the full card image, there is a web generator at [`https://danklinux.com/thumbnail-generator.html`](https://danklinux.com/thumbnail-generator.html) that produces cards matching the standard layout (see `docs/PREVIEWS.md` for the exact composition spec).

4. **Validate your plugin locally** before submitting:

   Run the following validation commands to ensure your plugin meets all requirements:

   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   pip install jinja2 requests

   # Validate JSON schema and required fields
   python3 .github/generate.py --validate

   # Validate links, paths, IDs, and names
   python3 .github/validate_links.py
   ```

   These validations check:
   - Valid JSON syntax (no trailing commas)
   - All required fields are present
   - Arrays use proper formatting
   - URLs are complete and accessible
   - Screenshot URLs are reachable
   - Repository URLs are valid
   - Plugin paths exist (for monorepo plugins)
   - **`id` field is in camelCase format and matches your repository's `plugin.json`**
   - **`name` field matches your repository's `plugin.json`**

5. **Submit a Pull Request**
   - Commit your JSON file
   - Push to your fork
   - Create a PR to this repository
   - Include a brief description of your plugin in the PR

## Guidelines

- Keep descriptions concise and informative
- Ensure your repository has proper documentation
- Test that your plugin works with the specified compositors and distros
- Capture your screenshot in a representative state — popout open, real data visible — ideally on the default dank purple theme (see [Previews](#previews))
- **IMPORTANT**: The `id` and `name` fields in your registry JSON file **must exactly match** the corresponding fields in your plugin repository's `plugin.json` file
  - For regular plugins: Must match `{repo}/plugin.json`
  - For monorepo plugins: Must match `{repo}/{path}/plugin.json`
- **IMPORTANT**: The `id` field must be in camelCase format (starts with lowercase, only letters/digits)

### Duplication & Quality

Avoid submitting plugins that duplicate existing ones unless:
- The original plugin is unmaintained (maintainer unresponsive to issues/PRs for over 30 days).
- It offers major functional improvements or significantly better design/integration with DMS.

Whenever possible, contribute upstream first. If submitting a successor to an existing plugin, link your upstream issue/PR in the submission.

## Plugin Translations

Any plugin can ship its own translations — a `translations/` directory with one JSON file per locale, loaded by DMS automatically. No approval needed, no registry involvement. See the [plugin development docs](https://danklinux.com/docs/dankmaterialshell/plugin-development#translations) for the file format and the `I18n.trFor` API.

On top of that, registry plugins can apply to join the central DMS POEditor project — the same one community translators use for DMS itself, currently covering 21 languages. Approved plugins get their strings translated alongside the shell, and finished translations come back to the plugin repo as PRs.

**Before applying:**

- Your plugin is listed in this registry and actively maintained
- Every user-facing string goes through `I18n.trFor("<your plugin id>", ...)`, with the id as a literal string exactly matching the `id` in your `plugin.json` — the extraction tooling reads call sites, so a variable there means your strings never get picked up

**Applying:**

1. Open a PR setting `"i18n": true` in your plugin's registry JSON. Include a short note: what the plugin does, roughly how many strings
2. On approval, a maintainer adds your repo to the translation sync. Your English strings get uploaded to POEditor, tagged with your plugin id
3. As translators finish languages, you get PRs adding `translations/<locale>.json` files to your repo — merge them and the translations ship with your next plugin update

**IMPORTANT**: Once your strings are in POEditor, renaming a term is a delete-plus-add — the old term's translations across every language are discarded. Keep English strings stable.

    "surfaceContainerHigh": "#hex",
    "error": "#hex",
    "warning": "#hex",
    "info": "#hex"
  }
}
```

### Field Descriptions

**Metadata:**
- **id** (required): Unique identifier in camelCase (e.g., `tokyoNight`, `gruvboxDark`)
- **name** (required): Display name of your theme
- **version** (required): Semver version (e.g., `1.0.0`)
- **author** (required): Your name or username
- **description** (required): Brief description of the theme

**Color Fields (required for both dark and light):**
- **primary**: Primary accent color
- **primaryText**: Text color on primary backgrounds
- **primaryContainer**: Container using primary color
- **secondary**: Secondary accent color
- **surface**: Main surface/card background
- **surfaceText**: Text on surfaces
- **surfaceVariant**: Alternative surface color
- **surfaceVariantText**: Text on variant surfaces
- **surfaceTint**: Tint overlay color
- **background**: App background color
- **backgroundText**: Text on background _(matugen-only — see note)_
- **outline**: Border/divider color
- **surfaceContainerLowest**: Lowest-elevation container background (darkest in dark mode, lightest in light mode) _(matugen-only — see note)_
- **surfaceContainerLow**: Low-elevation container background (between surface and surfaceContainer) _(matugen-only — see note)_
- **surfaceContainer**: Container background
- **surfaceContainerHigh**: Elevated container background
- **error**: Error state color
- **warning**: Warning state color
- **info**: Info state color

> **Note — matugen-only keys:** `surfaceContainerLowest`, `surfaceContainerLow`, and
> `backgroundText` are not rendered by DankMaterialShell's own UI. They complete the
> Material palette and are exported to matugen templates (VS Code, KDE, Firefox, Zed,
> etc.), so external apps themed via DMS use them. They are still required for a valid
> theme — pick sensible values that fit your palette.

### Theme Variants (Optional)

If your theme has multiple contrast levels or style options (like hard/medium/soft), you can use the `variants` field instead of defining all colors at the top level.

With variants, you put shared colors in the top-level `dark` and `light` objects, then define variant-specific colors in each variant option:

```json
{
  "id": "everforest",
  "name": "Everforest",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "fontaine",
  "description": "Everforest is a green based color scheme",
  "dark": {
    "surfaceText": "#d3c6aa",
    "primary": "#a7c080",
    "secondary": "#7fbbb3",
    "error": "#e57e80"
  },
  "light": {
    "surfaceText": "#5c6a72",
    "primary": "#8ca101",
    "secondary": "#dea000",
    "error": "#f75552"
  },
  "variants": {
    "default": "medium",
    "options": [
      {
        "id": "hard",
        "name": "Hard",
        "dark": {
          "surface": "#1e2326",
          "background": "#272e33",
          "surfaceContainer": "#2e383c"
        },
        "light": {
          "surface": "#f2efdf",
          "background": "#fffbef",
          "surfaceContainer": "#f2efdf"
        }
      },
      {
        "id": "medium",
        "name": "Medium",
        "dark": {
          "surface": "#232a2e",
          "background": "#2d353b",
          "surfaceContainer": "#343f44"
        },
        "light": {
          "surface": "#efebd4",
          "background": "#fdf6e3",
          "surfaceContainer": "#efebd4"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Variant Fields:**
- **variants.default**: The variant ID to use by default
- **variants.options**: Array of variant definitions
- **variants.options[].id**: Unique identifier for the variant
- **variants.options[].name**: Display name for the variant
- **variants.options[].dark/light**: Colors specific to this variant (merged with top-level colors)

Colors in variant options override the top-level colors. Put colors that stay the same across variants at the top level, and colors that change per variant in the variant options.

### Multi-Dimensional Variants (Optional)

For themes with two independent variant axes (like Catppuccin with flavor + accent), use `type: "multi"`:

```json
{
  "id": "catppuccin",
  "name": "Catppuccin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "Catppuccin",
  "description": "Soothing pastel theme",
  "dark": {},
  "light": {},
  "variants": {
    "type": "multi",
    "defaults": {
      "dark": { "flavor": "mocha", "accent": "mauve" },
      "light": { "flavor": "latte", "accent": "mauve" }
    },
    "flavors": [
      {
        "id": "mocha",
        "name": "Mocha",
        "dark": { "surface": "#181825", "surfaceText": "#cdd6f4", "..." }
      },
      {
        "id": "latte",
        "name": "Latte",
        "light": { "surface": "#e6e9ef", "surfaceText": "#4c4f69", "..." }
      }
    ],
    "accents": [
      {
        "id": "mauve",
        "name": "Mauve",
        "mocha": { "primary": "#cba6f7", "secondary": "#b4befe", "..." },
        "latte": { "primary": "#8839ef", "secondary": "#7287fd", "..." }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Multi-Variant Fields:**
- **variants.type**: Set to `"multi"` for two-dimensional variants
- **variants.defaults.dark**: Default flavor + accent for dark mode
- **variants.defaults.light**: Default flavor + accent for light mode
- **variants.flavors[]**: Base color sets (each has `dark` OR `light` key to indicate mode)
- **variants.accents[]**: Accent colors keyed by flavor ID

Resolution: `base[mode] + flavor[mode] + accent[flavorId]`

UI toggles dark/light mode → picks the corresponding default flavor+accent.

4. **Validate your theme locally**:

   ```bash
   pip install jinja2
   python3 .github/validate_themes.py
   python3 .github/generate.py --validate
   ```

5. **Submit a Pull Request**
   - Commit only your `theme.json` file (previews are auto-generated)
   - Push to your fork and create a PR
   - A preview will be generated and posted as a comment on your PR
   - After merge, the preview SVG will be committed automatically

## Guidelines

- All color values must be 6-digit hex codes (e.g., `#7aa2f7`)
- Both `dark` and `light` variants are required
- The `id` must be camelCase (starts lowercase, alphanumeric only)
- Version must follow semver format (`X.Y.Z`)
- Keep descriptions concise
- Test your colors for readability and contrast
